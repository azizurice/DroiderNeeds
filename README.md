# DroiderNeeds

This is a simple repository consisting of different examples. These examples are classified based on the level of understanding Android echosystem. Hope, it will help the beginners to learn Android development, intermediate learners to excel/enhance his/her understanding and advanced learners to recap his/her own experience (a place to enhance making use of Android development together for Advanced Android developer).

At the very beginning, I have added 21 apps for Organization purposes. At time being, most of them are just project skeleton. Along the way, all the projects will be updated gradually (The topics would be :very beginning issues, designing layouts for different devices, product flavors, testing and different important components of android development).
