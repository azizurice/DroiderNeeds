This is a very simple app. After installing Android Studio and configuring JDK (here we used JDK 1.8), if you create a new project with basic activity,
Android Studio will automatically create this project. If you go back the very fist commit, you will see this very simple app.

Thereafter, I have added code for doing addition. To develop an app which will do the addition of two numbers, what we need are :
  1. UI components (Two EditText for accepting two different numbers, one TextView for displaying result and One button for taking user instruction).
  2. Objects of UIs classes for bridging UIs with the code in your Activity class.
  3. One method for receiving user click and one method for doing math operation.
